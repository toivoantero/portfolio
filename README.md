## 💡 About

This portfolio was designed to present my work and skills in a clean, responsive format. When building the website, technically demanding solutions were not necessary.
The main goals in designing the site were simplicity and experimentation — both aesthetically and functionally.
The site is as easy to use as possible: all features are accessible without scrolling or clicking.
